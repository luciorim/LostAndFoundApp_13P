# Lost and Found

## Introduction  
This project is a web-based lost and found item tracking system for users to report, browse, and manage lost or found objects in their community or organization.

## Problem Statement  
Losing personal items in public places is common, and there is no centralized, structured system for reporting or tracking such items. This project addresses this gap by providing a reliable platform to connect people who lost items with those who found them.

## Objectives  
- To provide an easy-to-use platform for posting lost and found items.  
- To streamline item tracking and management.  
- To minimize the time and effort involved in returning lost items to their owners.

## Technology Stack  
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS  
- **Backend:** Python, Django  
- **Database:** Django ORM (PostgreSQL)  
- **Others:**  
  - Docker  
  - Nginx  
  - MinIO (for storing uploaded media)  
  - Silk (for profiling and performance analysis)
